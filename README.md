# flickr API scraper
An app that scrapes the flickr API from a tag and displays results in one page.

## Setup

## Accessibility concerns
There are some accessibility concerns with the wireframes, but to meet the requirements I will implement what is in the wireframes and instead improve the markup where possible.
* There are many "View on flickr" links with the same text, that would be confusing to people using assistive technologies;
* In the listing view, links are duplicated for the image and title and would be tedious to navigate for keyboard users.
